# Roadmap
JuliaMakers aims to take over the world. Just kidding - we're just a bunch of people who like to tinker with stuff and share what we've done! If you're one of those people please contact, join, or contribute with us. As far as I see it, we do have some mutual goals, and some neighboring organizations such as JuliaEmbedded. But don't take what's written here as some authoritative thing, all ideas are worth sharing and exploring. 

There are roughly 6 phases to getting this organization off of the ground
1. Understand the prexisting contributions from the Julia Community that may fall into this category.
2. Reach out to contributors, collaborators, let them know they are welcome here.
3. Find 'flagship' packages which should be included in this organization and don't step on toes.
4. Share some of our personal contributions in the form of projects of work in progress repositories.
5. Stoke the community with blog posts, funny projects, and positive feelings.
6. Keep thinking and keep tinkering!

Phase 1. Pre-existing contributions
There's a whole host of projects that could belong here. A list of my personal favorites starts with:
- https://github.com/emmt/AndorCameras.jl
- https://github.com/JuliaIO/AndorSIF.jl (may or may not belong here)
- XboxController (in review)
